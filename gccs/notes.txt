    Run NamingServer:
        ns -Djacorb.naming.ior_filename=/path/to/NS_Ref

    Run Server:
        jaco demo.benchmark.Server

    Run Client:
        jaco demo.bemnchmark.Client
Note:
    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place(in the current dir) and has 
    the name server reference such as -
    ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/path/to/NS_Ref

Remember to set ORBInitRef.NameService in jacorb.properties of Jacorb to the value found in MilifeSDK/etc/jacorb.properties,
by doing that, the Name manager can connect to name service of the SDK
e.g. ORBInitRef.NameService=corbaloc::localhost:2050/StandardNS/NameServer%2DPOA/_root


LOGGING
for each class, one should include the logging capabilities to it by following steps:
1. import logger:
	import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
2. declare logger member variable:
class Example {
....
	/**
	 * m_logger for the system
	 */
	static Logger m_logger;

	static {
		m_logger = Logger.getLogger(Example.class);
	}
	...
}
3. When want to log information about the progress of running program
	if (m_logger.isInfoEnabled()) {
		m_logger.info("<<<<<Logging information here>>>>>>");
	}
4. When want to log debug information for debugging purpose
	if (m_logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
		m_logger.debug("<<<<<Logging information here>>>>>>");
	}
5. For error reporting, we should always log the error message for debugging purpose
	m_logger.error("<<<<Detail about error message here>>>>");
	
SIMULATION WITH NUMBER TRANSLATION
In order to make demonstration about number translation with MiLife, we have to perform
the following steps:
1. Copy file aCallb.xml to folder %ISG_SDK%\etc\script\, where %ISG_SDK% is the installed
directory of Milife SDK
2. Start Milife SDK simulation tools, load script aCallb.xml
3. Select program "add subscribers", run it (in Milife SDK)
4. Start the monitor application (MyAppInit)
5. In simulation tools, select program "making call", to make calls
	you will see aPerson calling bPerson from the first step, but
	if the number translation was started, the call will be routed to pizzaRestaurant
