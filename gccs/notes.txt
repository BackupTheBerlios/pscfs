    Run NamingServer:
        ns -Djacorb.naming.ior_filename=/path/to/NS_Ref

    Run Server:
        jaco demo.benchmark.Server

    Run Client:
        jaco demo.bemnchmark.Client
Note:
    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place(in the current dir) and has 
    the name server reference such as -
    ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/path/to/NS_Ref

Remember to set ORBInitRef.NameService in jacorb.properties of Jacorb to the value found in MilifeSDK/etc/jacorb.properties,
by doing that, the Name manager can connect to name service of the SDK
e.g. ORBInitRef.NameService=corbaloc::localhost:2050/StandardNS/NameServer%2DPOA/_root
